# GMX-GLP

GMX is a decentralized trading platform on Arbitrum and Avalanche. GLP is a 
basket of crypto assets that serves as the platform's liquidity pool. This repo 
contains data analysis scripts for the following articles I wrote in order to 
understand GMX's business and GLP's returns and risks.
