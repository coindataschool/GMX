# GMX-GLP

GMX is a decentralized trading platform on Arbitrum and Avalanche. GLP is a 
basket of high grade digital assets that serves as the platform's liquidity 
pool. This repo contains data analysis scripts for the following articles I 
wrote in order to understand GMX's business and GLP's returns and risks.

Articles:

* [GMX Revenue Growth](https://coindataschool.substack.com/p/gmx-revenue-growth?r=1ly8yy&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)
* [GMX Revenue Breakdown](https://coindataschool.substack.com/p/gmx-revenue-breakdown?r=1ly8yy&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)
* [GLP Net Dollar Flow](https://coindataschool.substack.com/p/glp-net-dollar-flow?r=1ly8yy&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)
